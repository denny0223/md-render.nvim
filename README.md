# md-render.nvim

**English** · [正體中文（台灣）](README.zh-TW.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

This fork of [delphinus/md-render.nvim](https://github.com/delphinus/md-render.nvim) adds an optional Snacks backend for static images and diagrams in Kitty/tmux, viewport fitting, and an image tab with zoom and pan. See the [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/denny0223/.nvim) for a complete setup.

A Markdown rendering engine for Neovim. Transforms raw Markdown into richly highlighted, interactive content — right inside your editor. Supports floating windows, tab views, and a pager mode for `less`-like usage from the command line.

## Getting started

1. Check the [requirements](#requirements), then choose one [installation method](#installation).
2. To use this fork's Kitty/tmux support, viewport fitting, and image zoom/pan, follow the [Snacks image setup](#optional-snacks-image-backend). The basic installation keeps the native backend, which also supports animation and video.
3. Restart Neovim after installing and configuring the plugins. Open a Markdown file and run `:MdRender tab`. Use `q` to close the preview. With Snacks and `magick` configured, press Enter on a loaded image to open its image tab; `+` / `-` zoom, `hjkl` pan, `f` fits the whole image, and `q` returns to the document.

For the full [key reference](#keymaps), [commands](#commands), and [troubleshooting](#faq--troubleshooting), see below.

The complete [reference manual](doc/md-render.txt), including the library API, is also available inside Neovim with `:help md-render-contents@en`. Use `:help md-render-contents@tw` for Traditional Chinese (Taiwan), or `:help md-render-contents@ja` for Japanese.

</figure>

## Highlights

- **Rich inline formatting** — bold, strikethrough, inline code, links, Obsidian `==highlight==`, all rendered in-place
- **Tables** — box-drawing borders, column alignment, proportional sizing, and inline formatting within cells
- **Callouts & folds** — GitHub and Obsidian alert types with colored borders, icons, and folding you can toggle by clicking or with `za` / `<CR>`
- **Code blocks** — fenced blocks with treesitter syntax highlighting; expandable when truncated (click or `za` / `<CR>`)
- **Images** — local and web images (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, animated GIF) displayed inline via terminal graphics protocol
- **Video** — local and web video (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MKV, M4V) played as animated frames inline
- **Mermaid diagrams** — rendered as images inline
- **PlantUML diagrams** — rendered as images inline by a local renderer, or by a server you name
- **CommonMark paragraphs** — soft-wrapped source lines join into one paragraph, including a list item's continuation lines and a blockquote body; no extra space is inserted between CJK characters
- **CJK spacing around inline markers** — the spaces in `これは **強調** です。`, written only so that lenient parsers notice the `**`, are closed up on screen; they stay when a neighbour is narrow, as in `これは **API** です。`
- **Nested block structure** — a blockquote, callout, or fenced code block indented to a list item's content is rendered in place, not as literal text
- **CJK-aware word wrapping** — JIS X 4051 kinsoku shori + optional [BudouX](https://github.com/google/budoux) phrase segmentation via [budoux.lua](https://github.com/delphinus/budoux.lua)
- **Clickable links** — mouse click to open URLs; hover the mouse over a link to peek the full URL in a subtle floating window; OSC 8 hyperlink support for compatible terminals
- **`<details>` support** — collapsible sections you can toggle by clicking or with `za` / `<CR>`, respecting the `open` attribute
- **Status footer** — the floating preview shows the file name, your position in the source, and a box-drawing progress bar on its bottom border, without stealing a content row or touching your statusline
- **Library API** — use the rendering engine programmatically from your own plugins

## Try it yourself

After [installing and configuring the plugin](#installation), you can open the bundled showcase with the pager. Cloning the repository alone does not install the plugin into Neovim:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denny0223/md-render.nvim
cd md-render.nvim
nvim +"MdRender pager" assets/showcase.md
```

Or, once the plugin is installed, run `:MdRender demo` to see a built-in demo of every supported notation.

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.12 (uses `vim.api.nvim_ui_send` for terminal writes)
- For inline images and video with the default native backend (`kitty`): a terminal supporting the [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).
  Verified on [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) (macOS/Linux).
- The optional [Snacks backend](#optional-snacks-image-backend) also requires Unicode placeholders. Its documented setup targets Kitty, directly or inside tmux.

<summary><strong>Dependencies by feature</strong></summary>

These dependencies are optional for basic Markdown rendering, but required for the features that use them. Plugin managers install Neovim plugins; install command-line tools separately and make them available on Neovim's `$PATH`.

| Dependency | Purpose | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| [curl](https://curl.se/) | Download web images and video | Custom function via `set_download_fn()` |
| [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) | Optional image backend, viewport fitting, and focused image tabs | Default native backend remains available; it does not provide these fork features |
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (`ffmpeg` / `ffprobe`) | Native JPEG/WebP → PNG conversion; GIF / video frame extraction for both backends | Falls back to ImageMagick (images only; video requires ffmpeg) |
| [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) (`magick`) | Snacks image conversion and image-tab zoom/pan; native image conversion and shared GIF frame extraction | Native conversion can use the tools below. The image tab requires `magick`, including for PNG; `ffmpeg`, `sips`, or an installation providing only `convert` cannot replace it |
| [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) (`mmdc`) and its headless browser | Render Mermaid diagrams with either backend | Falls back to `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (requires Node.js/npm and may download the CLI); the browser is still required |
| [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) (`plantuml`, or `java` with `$PLANTUML_JAR`) | Render PlantUML diagrams as images | A PlantUML server, if you name one (needs curl); otherwise the fence stays a code block |
| [budoux.lua](https://github.com/delphinus/budoux.lua) | CJK phrase-level line breaking (BudouX) | Character-level splitting (kinsoku rules still apply) |
| Treesitter parsers | Syntax highlighting in code blocks | Code blocks rendered without highlighting |
| [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) or [mini.icons](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.icons) | File type icons in code block headers | Built-in icon table |

Static conversion in the **native backend** and frame extraction in both backends try tools in this order. [Snacks conversion](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/image.md) uses ImageMagick for static non-PNG images.

| Use case | 1st | 2nd | 3rd |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static image conversion (JPEG/WebP → PNG) | `sips` (macOS) | `ffmpeg` | `magick` |
| Animated GIF frame extraction | `ffmpeg` | `magick` | — |
| Video frame extraction | `ffmpeg` | — | — |

## Installation

The examples below use the default native backend (`kitty`). For Kitty/tmux images, viewport fitting, and zoom/pan, follow [Optional Snacks image backend](#optional-snacks-image-backend) as well. Use this fork's default branch: its inherited upstream release tags do not include those features, so the lazy.nvim examples use `version = false`.

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "denny0223/md-render.nvim",
  version = false,
  cmd = "MdRender",
  dependencies = {
    { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", version = "*" }, -- optional: file type icons in code blocks
    { "delphinus/budoux.lua", version = "*" }, -- optional: CJK phrase-level line breaking
  },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>mp", "<Plug>(md-render-preview)",     desc = "Markdown preview (toggle)" },
    { "<leader>mt", "<Plug>(md-render-preview-tab)", desc = "Markdown preview in tab (toggle)" },
    { "<leader>md", "<Plug>(md-render-demo)",        desc = "Markdown render demo" },
  },
}
```

### vim.pack (Neovim 0.12+)

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  "https://github.com/denny0223/md-render.nvim",
  -- optional:
  "https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
  "https://github.com/delphinus/budoux.lua",
})
```

### mini.deps

```lua
local add = MiniDeps.add
add({
  source = "denny0223/md-render.nvim",
  depends = {
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- optional
    "delphinus/budoux.lua",        -- optional
  },
})
```

### Optional Snacks image backend

This setup enables static images, diagrams, viewport fitting, and focused image tabs. It requires:

- [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim), loaded and configured before opening an md-render preview.
- Kitty with Unicode placeholder support. Inside tmux, add `set -g allow-passthrough on` to your tmux configuration and reload it. Other terminals supported by Snacks have not been verified with this integration; the native backend's terminal list above does not establish Snacks compatibility.
- ImageMagick with the `magick` command on Neovim's `$PATH` for the complete image workflow, including zoom/pan. Installing only FFmpeg or `sips` is insufficient.
- For Mermaid, the Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`, or the `npx` fallback) and its headless browser. Snacks handles image display; it does not replace the diagram renderer. No browser window is opened.

For lazy.nvim, use this in place of the basic md-render spec above. Keep the optional icon/BudouX dependencies if you use them:

```lua
{
  "denny0223/md-render.nvim",
  version = false,
  cmd = "MdRender",
  dependencies = {
    {
      "folke/snacks.nvim",
      lazy = false,
      priority = 1000,
      opts = {
        image = {
          enabled = true,
          doc = { enabled = false },
          math = { enabled = false },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  config = function()
    require("md-render.image").setup({ backend = "snacks" })
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>mp", "<Plug>(md-render-preview)",     desc = "Markdown preview (toggle)" },
    { "<leader>mt", "<Plug>(md-render-preview-tab)", desc = "Markdown preview in tab (toggle)" },
    { "<leader>md", "<Plug>(md-render-demo)",        desc = "Markdown render demo" },
  },
}
```

For vim.pack, add `"https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim"` to the `vim.pack.add()` list. For mini.deps, add `"folke/snacks.nvim"` to md-render's `depends` list. After both plugins have loaded, configure them in this order:

```lua
require("snacks").setup({
  image = {
    enabled = true,
    doc = { enabled = false },
    math = { enabled = false },
  },
})
require("md-render.image").setup({ backend = "snacks" })
```

If you already configure Snacks, merge these `image` options into its existing configuration; do not call `setup()` a second time. Disabling Snacks' document and math rendering lets md-render own the Markdown preview; those Snacks features are not needed by this integration.

After loading the plugins, check the setup:

1. Run `:checkhealth snacks`. Check that `:echo executable('magick')` returns `1` and `:lua print(require("md-render.image").config().backend)` prints `snacks`.
2. Inside tmux, `tmux show-options -gv allow-passthrough` should print `on`.
3. In Kitty, open a Markdown file containing a local PNG and run `:MdRender tab`. Wait for the image to appear, place the cursor on it or its title, and press Enter to verify that its image tab opens. Tool availability alone does not verify terminal display.

Both backends play animated GIFs and videos. The Snacks backend uses Kitty animation support, including inside tmux; video frame extraction requires `ffmpeg`. The Snacks backend prepares images throughout the document, including off-screen images; diagram rendering, downloads, and frame extraction share a two-job limit across previews, and work already running may finish into the cache after closing a preview. Image-heavy documents therefore do more work up front.

Automatic layout uses the available window width instead of the native backend's 80-column cap. Images fit proportionally within that width and the window height minus six rows, without enlarging beyond their original pixel size. An explicitly supplied `max_width` still takes precedence. See [Image tab keys](#image-tab-keys) for navigation.

## Comparison with similar plugins

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not other Markdown previewers?</strong></summary>

- **[markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)** — Excellent for true browser-quality rendering, but requires a browser context. md-render runs entirely inside the terminal.
- **[render-markdown.nvim](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim)** — Beautiful in-buffer rendering, but modifies the editing buffer itself. md-render keeps your editing buffer untouched and renders into a separate floating/tab window or pager view.
- **[mcat](https://github.com/Skardyy/mcat)** — Closest in spirit (a pure-terminal Markdown renderer), but lacks complex layout features like auto-folding tables, click-to-toggle folds, and CJK word wrapping.

md-render.nvim aims to be a dedicated previewer that runs entirely in the terminal, with rich layout support and first-class CJK handling.

## Keymaps

The plugin provides `<Plug>` mappings but does **not** set any default keybindings. Map them yourself:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mp", "<Plug>(md-render-preview)",     { desc = "Markdown preview (toggle)" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mt", "<Plug>(md-render-preview-tab)", { desc = "Markdown preview in tab (toggle)" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>md", "<Plug>(md-render-demo)",        { desc = "Markdown render demo" })
```

| `<Plug>` mapping | Description |
|---|---|
| `<Plug>(md-render-preview)` | Toggle a floating preview window for the current Markdown buffer |
| `<Plug>(md-render-preview-tab)` | Toggle a tab preview for the current Markdown buffer |
| `<Plug>(md-render-toggle)` | Toggle the current window between source and render mode in place |
| `<Plug>(md-render-auto)` | **[experimental]** Toggle auto mode (render outside Insert) for the current buffer |
| `<Plug>(md-render-split)` | Open a split showing source and rendered Markdown |
| `<Plug>(md-render-demo)` | Show a demo window with all supported Markdown notations |

### In-preview keys

Inside a rendered preview (floating, tab, split, or in-place toggle), these buffer-local keys are set automatically:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `za` | Toggle the fold / expandable region under the cursor (no-op elsewhere) |
| `<CR>` | Open the image under the cursor (Snacks backend), or toggle a fold / expandable region |
| `gf` | Follow the local file link under the cursor; Markdown targets stay rendered |
| `<LeftMouse>` | Toggle folds, expand regions, and open links by clicking |
| `q` / `<Esc>` / `<C-c>` | Close the window (floating / tab mode only) |

`gf` resolves the link destination relative to its source Markdown file, independently of the working directory. Markdown targets keep the current preview window; other files open for editing in the original source window, closing floating/tab previews. `Ctrl-O` returns to the preceding rendered document with its reading position and folds; after editing another file, that rendered return uses the source window. Outside a link, native `gf` and counts such as `2gf` still work.

Directories open in the original source window through the configured directory browser (such as netrw), closing floating/tab previews. The browser retains its own navigation and buffer lifecycle.

`Ctrl-O` and `Ctrl-I` remain native Neovim commands. Each window keeps its own jumplist: after opening another file in the source editing window, only the immediately preceding rendered document is guaranteed on return. Earlier preview history is not merged into that window.

Local links support relative paths, POSIX absolute paths, and `file:///` URLs, including encoded filenames, inline/reference links, and optional titles. Missing or unreadable files leave the preview unchanged. Fragments do not yet select a heading; pager navigation and Windows/UNC paths are outside this feature's initial scope.

### Image tab keys

With the [Snacks backend](#optional-snacks-image-backend) configured and ImageMagick (`magick`) installed, press Enter on an image or its title to open a focused image tab. Use arrows or `hjkl` to move, `+/-` to zoom, `f` to fit the complete image, and `q` to return. These keys are set automatically in the image tab.

GIF and video tabs require Kitty 0.31 or newer and play automatically. Press Space to pause or resume; zooming and panning preserve the playback state. Playback controls affect only the image tab.

Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom, or hold the left mouse button and drag to move the image. Vim-style navigation, Page Up/Down, Home/End, and counts are also supported. Press `?` or use `:help md-render-image-view` for the [complete reference](doc/md-render.txt).

Zoom uses the converted image's existing pixels; it does not regenerate a higher-resolution diagram.

## Commands

The plugin exposes a single `:MdRender` command with subcommands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `:MdRender` | Floating preview window (alias of `:MdRender float`) |
| `:MdRender float` | Toggle a floating preview window |
| `:MdRender tab` | Toggle a tab preview |
| `:MdRender toggle` | Toggle the current window between source and render mode in place |
| `:MdRender split` | Open a split showing source and rendered Markdown (honours `:vert`, `:tab`, `:topleft`, `:botright`) |
| `:MdRender auto [on\|off\|toggle]` | **[experimental]** Auto-toggle source/render based on Insert mode (per buffer) |
| `:MdRender textsize [on\|off\|toggle\|auto\|image\|native\|status]` | **[experimental]** Scale headings with auto selection, native text or images; inspect the active backend |
| `:MdRender pager` | Pager mode — full-screen, no chrome, `q` to quit Neovim |
| `:MdRender demo` | Show a demo window with all supported Markdown notations |

Tab completion lists the subcommands for the first arg, `on` / `off` / `toggle` after `auto` and `textsize`, and `auto` / `image` / `native` / `status` after `textsize`.

> **Backwards compatibility.** The legacy top-level commands (`:MdRenderTab`, `:MdRenderToggle`, `:MdRenderSplit`, `:MdRenderAuto`, `:MdRenderPager`, `:MdRenderDemo`) still work and forward to the new dispatcher. They print a one-shot deprecation warning per Neovim session and will be removed in a future major version.

### In-place toggle

`:MdRender toggle` swaps the current window between the source Markdown buffer and a rendered view of it — without opening a new tab or floating window. This is designed for split layouts where you want, for example, code in one split and the rendered README in the other.

```vim
:vsplit README.md
:MdRender toggle
```

Behavior:

- The render buffer is **read-only** and reused across toggles (one render buffer per source).
- When the same source is shown in multiple windows, only the invoking window swaps; edits from other windows are reflected on the next toggle into render mode.
- Cursor position round-trips between source and render via the source-line mapping.
- `number`, `relativenumber`, and `list` are turned off on render-mode windows. The originals are stashed on the window and restored when toggling back to source.
- Inside render mode, `q` / `<Esc>` / `<C-c>` are **not** bound to close — call `:MdRender toggle` again to return to source mode. `<LeftMouse>`, `za`, and `<CR>` still toggle folds and expand regions (and `<LeftMouse>` opens links). With the Snacks backend, `<CR>` also opens images.

### Auto-toggle on Insert mode (experimental)

> **Experimental.** This feature is new and the UX may change. Please report issues or rough edges.

`:MdRender auto on` keeps the current buffer in render mode while in Normal mode and swaps back to source automatically when you start editing. Pass `off` to disable, or call `:MdRender auto` (or `:MdRender auto toggle`) to toggle. To opt every Markdown buffer in:

```vim
autocmd FileType markdown silent! MdRender auto on
```

See `:help :MdRender-auto` for behavior details — the `i` / `I` / `a` / `A` / `o` / `O` remaps, `:w` forwarding, and the editing operations that are blocked on the read-only render buffer.

### Scaled headings (experimental)

Headings default to `auto`: **image → native OSC 66 → ordinary text**. Images require a positive terminal PNG response, measured cell dimensions, `termguicolors` and a working Pango/Cairo renderer. If any environment requirement fails, `auto` tries native sizing; if that is unavailable too, headings stay ordinary text. Pending work also leaves text visible. Individual unsupported headings retain text without changing the backend for other headings.

`:MdRender textsize status` reports the selected policy, effective backend and fallback reason. PNG acknowledgement has a 1.5-second timeout; layout work has a 5-second timeout. Environment failures are cached for the session without repeated subprocesses or automatic warnings. Run `:MdRender textsize auto` to retry after fixing the environment. Source/render toggling and `off` / `on` retain your backend choice; `native` skips image detection and dependencies, while explicit `image` falls back only to ordinary text. Configure `backend = "auto"` in the setup below to retain automatic selection.

#### Try image headings

Run `:MdRender textsize image`, then open a preview as usual with `:MdRender toggle`. Existing previews update immediately. `:MdRender textsize native` restores OSC 66 headings; `:MdRender textsize off` shows ordinary text.

This experimental backend uses [Pango](https://www.pango.org/) and [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) for natural glyph spacing at the six heading sizes. It requires Python 3, PyGObject, Pycairo, and introspection data for Pango/PangoCairo and Cairo. Missing dependencies leave headings as ordinary text. To configure the font and base size in pixels:

```lua
require("md-render.text_size").setup {
  backend = "image",
  image = { font = "Noto Sans Mono,Noto Sans Mono CJK TC", font_size = "auto", python = "python3" },
}
```

The default `font_size = "auto"` calibrates the configured font against the terminal cell dimensions and preserves six distinct heading ratios. A positive pixel size overrides it. Pango measures wrapping and glyph positions; those same byte ranges define the buffer text, inline styles and link targets. Layouts are produced asynchronously and reused while the preview is open.

Hover keeps images in place. A click resolves the visible glyph, including the lower image row, through the existing internal-anchor handler. Moving through a heading's left margin keeps its image; moving the cursor into the image area reveals that rendered segment so the cursor stays accurate. Dragging selects from the clicked character, and Visual selection reveals only headings on the selected rows. User-provided yank/highlight feedback also reveals the affected rows for its own duration, then images return. Search matches remain visible without hiding unrelated headings or clearing the search state. Visible inactive previews retain their images, and reflow/backend changes preserve the source passage and heading character being read. Background reflow waits for selections, pending operators, command-line input and yank feedback to finish.

Images use your `MdRenderH1`–`MdRenderH6` and inline highlight groups, with `Normal` or `NormalFloat` providing the base colors. Unset backgrounds stay transparent; a window-scoped text overlay prevents the underlying glyphs showing through without changing buffer text or coordinates. Colors, backgrounds, bold, italic, underlines and strikethrough retain their Markdown style order below user highlights such as `vim.hl.on_yank()`. Custom reverse, `nocombine`, blending, alternate underline styles or window highlight overrides use text fallback. Missing glyphs, oversized fonts, unrepresentable text/link targets and headings inside `<details>` also retain text. Colorscheme and terminal resize events refresh layouts; after changing font or highlight settings directly, `:MdRender textsize image` refreshes manually and retries failed rendering. Use `:MdRender textsize status` for the fallback reason; explicit image mode also reports renderer errors in `:messages`.

**Terminal interactions:** in an in-place preview, use `:MdRender toggle` to return to Markdown source before Shift-drag selection; toggle again to resume the preview. Open internal anchors with an ordinary mouse click; use `gf` on local file links. Terminal OSC 8 modifier-clicks are not supported over images.

**Compatibility:** image headings require Neovim >= 0.12, confirmed PNG support and `termguicolors`; native sizing requires Kitty >= 0.40. Tested on Linux with direct Kitty and a loopback SSH PTY to Linux. Python, Pango/Cairo and the configured fonts belong on the Neovim host; PNG bytes travel through the terminal connection without shared image files. Image headings are disabled on Windows and through tmux. Other OS/client combinations remain unverified. For terminal tools or assistive technology that needs a text-only view, use `textsize off` or the source buffer; screen-reader compatibility has not been tested.

#### Native text headings

> **Experimental.** New and Kitty-only. The UX may change or the feature may be withdrawn. Please report issues or rough edges.

Kitty 0.40 added the [text sizing protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/) (OSC 66), which draws text at a multiple of the base font size. md-render uses it to give every heading level its own size:

| Level | `#` | `##` | `###` | `####` | `#####` | `######` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Size | 2.00x | 1.75x | 1.50x | 1.40x | 1.25x | 1.17x |

Select this renderer with `:MdRender textsize native`; `auto` uses it when image requirements fail. Search, selection and user highlights temporarily reveal ordinary text. Turn scaling off with `:MdRender textsize off`, or permanently with:

```lua
require("md-render.text_size").setup { enabled = false }
```

The ladder is fixed. Kitty's `s=` scale multiplies the *cells* a run occupies, not just the font, so every level stays at `s=2` — one extra rendered row, never more — and the sizes below 2x come from the protocol's fractional scale plus a `w=` width per run. The protocol caps `d` at 15 and `w` at 7, which is why the deepest level lands on 1.17x rather than something closer to plain.

Headings wrap at `1 / size` of the usual width so that every level scales rather than only the ones that happen to fit, and each wrapped line gets its own two-row block.

A fractionally scaled heading goes out as several runs, because each has to declare its width in whole cells while its text does not measure a whole number of them. That width is rounded up — Kitty drops characters that do not fit — and the runs are cut where the leftover cell disappears: at a boundary that comes out exact where there is one, and otherwise after a space, so the slack reads as a slightly wider word gap instead of a hole in a word.

An emoji gets a run to itself. A run that declares a width is one multicell character to Kitty, and a multicell is shaped with a single font, so an emoji sharing a run with ordinary text takes the whole run down with it: measured on Kitty 0.48, every cell of the run turns into a missing-glyph box when the emoji sits in the middle of it, and the rest of the text is dropped when the emoji comes first. Alone in a run it renders correctly. The cost is the rounding that run carries of its own, which shows as slightly wider gaps either side of the emoji, and a heading that no longer fits is left plain. `#` is exempt: it scales with `s=` alone, so its run declares no width and Kitty splits the text into cells and picks a font per cell itself.

The scaled text is written straight to the terminal, the same way inline images are, so Neovim knows nothing about it. The plain-size heading stays in the buffer underneath and the scaled text is painted over it — every terminal repaint degrades to the normal heading rather than to a blank line, and `y` / `/` / `:w` still see the real text.

Known limitations:

- **Kitty >= 0.40 only.** Support is detected by asking the terminal to identify itself (XTVERSION) and requires a positive answer. This is deliberately strict: some terminals swallow an OSC 66 sequence *together with its payload text*, which would delete the heading rather than fall back to unscaled text. Everywhere else the feature costs nothing and headings render as they always did.
- Inline formatting inside a heading (inline code, links, `==highlight==`) loses its colors while scaled.
- Every level reserves a two-row block while only `#` fills it, so the rest are centered in theirs (`v=2`) instead of sitting against the top edge, which is the protocol's default. At `######` — 1.17x in a block twice as tall — the top edge left almost a whole row empty under the heading.
- The level icon stays at normal size, but goes out as a run of its own rather than as the plain text underneath, so it is centered in the same block and stays level with the heading it labels (`n=1:d=2` against `s=2` cancels the cell scale exactly). Its own run is also what keeps it legible: Kitty gives a scaled run exactly `s` cells per source cell, and these Nerd Font glyphs report as one cell wide while being drawn wider, so sharing the heading's run would clip the icon — `󰉬` would render as a bare "H". Alone, `w=1` gives it the two-cell block the icon already occupies, and it fits.
- A heading whose second row would fall outside the window stays plain until scrolled into view.
- A repaint by anything else (another plugin forcing a redraw, a message or popup overlapping the window, the terminal shifting cells for a mouse scroll) drops the heading back to plain size, and there is no way to stop that happening. Recovery is on three signals, in order of how quickly they arrive: a scroll, resize, or window opening or closing repaints at once; any redraw at all is picked up from a decoration provider on the tick after it; and `SafeState` covers the rest, rate-limited, with a 500 ms timer behind it for a repaint that never settles. md-render's own repaints are handled properly rather than waited out — inline images and scaled headings both draw outside Neovim's grid and are both destroyed by a full repaint, so whichever of the two repaints announces it and the other puts itself back at once.
- **A plugin that repaints inside `eventignore = "all"` costs a frame that cannot be recovered any sooner.** Autocmds are how everything above learns that anything happened, and that setting silences all of them. The decoration provider still fires — it is not an autocmd — so the heading comes back on the next tick, but it does go for that one frame. [nvim-scrollview](https://github.com/dstein64/nvim-scrollview) is the known case: it opens a float the size of the whole editor, moves a dozen small ones and closes them again, about twenty times a second while the mouse moves, all of it inside `eventignore = "all"`. Measured over fifteen seconds, 308 calls to `nvim_open_win` produced one `WinNew`. To turn it off while a preview is on screen, match on `b:md_render` (set on every buffer md-render renders into) rather than pairing open and close events — a preview can be opened more than once and split by hand, and asking "is one open" needs no bookkeeping:

  ```lua
  local off = false
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "WinNew", "WinClosed", "BufWinEnter" }, {
    callback = vim.schedule_wrap(function()
      local want = false
      for _, w in ipairs(vim.api.nvim_list_wins()) do
        if vim.b[vim.api.nvim_win_get_buf(w)].md_render then
          want = true
          break
        end
      end
      if want ~= off then
        off = want
        vim.cmd(want and "ScrollViewDisable" or "ScrollViewEnable")
      end
    end),
  })
  ```

- Each layout change costs a full-screen repaint to clear the previous scaled run, so scrolling is more expensive than usual. When the window also holds images the image redraw does that clearing, and the scaled text is simply written after it.
- The Telescope and Snacks previewers opt out. They redraw on every cursor step, and a full-screen repaint per step is not something a picker can afford.

See `:help md-render-text-size` for the full rationale.

### Source/render split

  <figcaption><em>Source/render split — edits propagate live, including inline images</em></figcaption>
</figure>

`:MdRender split` opens a split showing the source buffer and the rendered view together. Direction follows standard Vim split modifiers:

- `:MdRender split` — horizontal split
- `:vert MdRender split` — vertical split (typical "README + code" layout)
- `:tab MdRender split` — split inside a new tab
- `:topleft MdRender split` — place at the top
- `:botright MdRender split` — place at the bottom

Edits to the source propagate live, and cursor/scroll position is synchronized in both directions. See `:help :MdRender-split` for full behavior and the inline-image limitation.

### Pager mode

  <figcaption><em>Pager mode — browse Markdown like <code>less</code></em></figcaption>
</figure>

Use `:MdRender pager` to view Markdown files like `less`:

```bash
nvim +"MdRender pager" README.md
```

Add a shell alias for convenience:

```bash
alias mdless='nvim +"MdRender pager"'
mdless README.md
```

  <figcaption><em>Telescope previewer with md-render</em></figcaption>
</figure>

### Previewer

`require("md-render.telescope").previewer()` creates a previewer that can be
passed to any [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
picker — builtin, extension, or custom:

```lua
local previewer = require("md-render.telescope").previewer()

require("telescope.builtin").find_files({ previewer = previewer })
require("telescope").extensions.egrepify.egrepify({ previewer = previewer })
```

The previewer automatically handles three kinds of files:

| File type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Markdown (`.md`, `.markdown`) | Full md-render rendering with highlights, links, and images |
| Image / Video (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, MP4, ...) | Inline display via Kitty graphics protocol |
| Other files | Falls back to telescope's default previewer with syntax highlighting |

For grep-based pickers, the preview scrolls to the matched line.

### `:Telescope md_render` Extension

A shortcut for builtin pickers. Wraps `telescope.builtin` pickers with the
md-render previewer. All arguments are passed through:

```vim
:Telescope md_render find_files
:Telescope md_render live_grep cwd=~/notes
:Telescope md_render grep_string search=TODO
```

## Snacks.nvim Integration

`require("md-render.snacks").preview()` creates a preview function for
[snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) pickers. It handles the
same three file types as the telescope previewer (Markdown, image/video, and
fallback).

This picker integration is separate from the [Snacks image backend](#optional-snacks-image-backend). If Snacks is already configured, merge one of the following `picker` tables into that configuration instead of calling `setup()` again.

Configure it globally to apply to all pickers:

```lua
require("snacks").setup({
  picker = {
    preview = require("md-render.snacks").preview(),
  },
})
```

Or per-source:

```lua
require("snacks").setup({
  picker = {
    sources = {
      files = { preview = require("md-render.snacks").preview() },
      grep = { preview = require("md-render.snacks").preview() },
    },
  },
})
```

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong><code>:MdRender</code> is not an editor command</strong></summary>

Check that your plugin manager has installed and loaded `denny0223/md-render.nvim`. For lazy.nvim, keep `cmd = "MdRender"` in the spec so typing the command loads the plugin. Cloning the repository alone does not install it; follow [Installation](#installation), then restart Neovim.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Images don't show — only their alt text or filenames appear</strong></summary>

With the default native backend, inline image display requires a terminal supporting the [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/), such as **WezTerm**, **Kitty**, or **Ghostty**. For Kitty inside tmux, use the [Snacks setup and checks](#optional-snacks-image-backend), including `allow-passthrough`. Enabling tmux passthrough alone does not add tmux support to the native backend.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Videos appear as a single static frame</strong></summary>

Both backends require `ffmpeg` in `$PATH` for video frame extraction. The Snacks backend plays those frames in Kitty, including inside tmux. Without it, the plugin falls back to displaying just the first frame as a still image. Install it via your package manager (e.g. `brew install ffmpeg`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enter does not open an image tab</strong></summary>

Use a document preview such as `:MdRender tab`, select the [Snacks backend](#optional-snacks-image-backend), and check that `:echo executable('magick')` returns `1`. Wait for the image to finish loading, then place the cursor on it or its title before pressing Enter. The built-in `:MdRender demo` window does not provide this image-opening action.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mermaid diagrams don't render</strong></summary>

Mermaid rendering requires the `mmdc` binary from [@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli). If `mmdc` isn't installed globally, the plugin falls back to `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, which is significantly slower on first invocation. Install it globally with `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` for faster rendering.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>PlantUML diagrams don't render</strong></summary>

Fenced blocks tagged `plantuml` or `puml` are rendered locally when a `plantuml` binary is on your `PATH` (most package managers ship one), or when `java` is available and `$PLANTUML_JAR` points at a readable `plantuml.jar`. Install one of those and the fence becomes a diagram.

There is no fallback unless you ask for one. PlantUML renders on a server by design, and rendering on somebody else's means sending the diagram there, so the plugin will not choose that for you — without a local renderer, a `plantuml` fence stays a code block. Name a server and it will be used:

```lua
require("md-render.image").setup {
  -- Your own instance, or "https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml" for the public
  -- one. Either way the diagram source is sent there, so pick knowing that.
  plantuml_server = "https://plantuml.example.com/plantuml",
}
```

The server also needs `curl`. Rendered diagrams are cached under `stdpath("cache")/md-render/plantuml`, keyed by the diagram source, so a diagram is only sent once.

<details>
<summary><strong>Japanese text wrapping looks unnatural</strong></summary>

By default, md-render applies JIS X 4051 kinsoku shori (forbidden line-break rules) at the character level. For phrase-level segmentation that respects natural word boundaries in Japanese, install [budoux.lua](https://github.com/delphinus/budoux.lua) — the plugin will automatically detect and use it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The spaces around <code>**</code> disappeared in Japanese text</strong></summary>

That is deliberate. `これは **強調** です。` is usually written with those spaces so that a parser which only recognises a `**` surrounded by whitespace still sees the emphasis. CommonMark needs no such help — `これは**強調**です。` emphasises just fine — so once the markers are gone the spaces are pure markup and read as gaps. md-render closes them up when the characters on both sides are East Asian wide, the same rule it applies to the space CommonMark inserts at a soft line break.

A space next to a narrow character is left alone, so `これは **API** です。` and `これは **1** 番目` keep theirs. So does a space between two adjacent spans — in `**あ** **い**`, or in two links in a row, it is the only thing holding them apart on screen.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code blocks have no syntax highlighting</strong></summary>

Syntax highlighting requires the corresponding Treesitter parser to be available. Neovim bundles parsers for several languages, including Lua. Install additional parsers with [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter), or see `:help treesitter-parsers` for manual installation.

</details>

## Usage as a library

<details>
<summary><strong>Programmatic API</strong></summary>

Use the rendering engine to build highlighted content programmatically:

```lua
local md = require("md-render")

-- Render a single line of markdown
local text, highlights, links = md.Markdown.render("**bold** and [link](https://example.com)")

-- Build full document content
local ContentBuilder = md.ContentBuilder
local b = ContentBuilder.new()
b:render_document(lines, {
  max_width = 80,
  indent = "  ",
  repo_base_url = "https://github.com/user/repo",
  autolinks = {
    { key_prefix = "JIRA-", url_template = "https://jira.example.com/browse/JIRA-<num>" },
  },
})
local content = b:result()

-- Apply to a buffer
local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)
local ns = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace("my_ns")
md.display_utils.apply_content_to_buffer(buf, ns, content)

-- Display images (requires a Kitty Graphics Protocol compatible terminal)
-- Images are automatically cleaned up when the window is closed.
local win = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
md.display_utils.setup_images(win, content, ns)
```

</details>
