--- Fenced code block delimiters, as CommonMark / GFM define them.
---
--- A fence is a run of at least three backticks or three tildes.  The info
--- string after it may be separated by spaces (``` bash), and its first word
--- is the language.  A block is closed only by a run of the *same* character
--- that is at least as long as the opening one and followed by nothing but
--- whitespace, so ```` can wrap a sample that itself contains ```, and a
--- ~~~ block can hold ``` lines.
---
--- Every pass that has to skip code (tab expansion, container indent,
--- paragraph joining, footnote collection, the renderer itself) tracks fences
--- through this module, so they all agree on where a block starts and ends.
