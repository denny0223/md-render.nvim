--- Kitty text sizing protocol (OSC 66) support for md-render.nvim.
---
--- Draws selected buffer lines at a multiple of the base font size by writing
--- OSC 66 sequences straight to the terminal, the same way `md-render.image`
--- writes Kitty graphics escapes. Every heading level `#` … `######` gets its
--- own multiplier, from 2x down to about 1.17x.
---
---     OSC 66 ; s=<scale>:n=<num>:d=<den>:w=<cells> ; <text> ST
---
--- Unlike graphics placements, OSC 66 text lives in the terminal's *text*
--- layer, so Neovim destroys it as soon as it repaints those cells. There is no
--- equivalent of `a=p` (re-place an already transmitted image) either: the whole
--- string has to be sent again. This module therefore keeps the plain-size text
--- in the buffer and only paints over it, so that every repaint degrades to the
--- normal heading instead of to a blank line, and re-paints on a 50 ms debounce
--- after scroll / cursor movement.
---
--- Support is gated on a positive XTVERSION answer from Kitty >= 0.40. This is
--- deliberately strict: WezTerm swallows an OSC 66 sequence *including its
--- payload text*, so a wrong guess deletes content rather than degrading to
--- unscaled text.

-- ============================================================================
-- Configuration
-- ============================================================================

--- The largest `w=` the protocol allows, i.e. how many scaled cells one run
--- may cover. This is what bounds the ladder below: a run has to carry enough
--- source cells to be worth splitting on, and `w <= 7` puts a floor on how
--- close to plain size a level can get (roughly 7/6).
local MAX_W = 7

--- Heading level → how `#` … `######` are scaled. Fixed, not user-configurable.
---
--- `s` is Kitty's *cell* scale: the run is drawn in a block `s` cells high and
--- `s * w` cells wide, so raising it costs a rendered row and halves (thirds,
--- …) the width the heading may wrap at. Every level therefore stays at
--- `s = 2` — one extra row, no more — and the ladder from `#` to `######`
--- comes from the fractional scale instead. `n` / `d` shrink the *font* inside
--- the block without changing the cells it occupies, giving an effective size
--- of `s * n / d`.
---
--- Because the fraction does not shrink the cells, `w` has to: it says how
--- many cells the run's text is rendered in, so a level at 1.5x sends four
--- source cells' worth of text in a six-cell run. `split_run` does that
--- splitting; `chunk` below is how many source cells one run may carry.
---
--- Both protocol keys are bounded — `d <= 15` and `w <= 7` — which is why the
--- deepest level lands on 7/12 rather than a rounder ratio.

--- Where a fractionally scaled run sits inside its `s`-row block (`v=`):
--- 0 top, 1 bottom, 2 centered. Kitty ignores it unless `n < d`, so `#` — the
--- one level with no fraction — is unaffected either way: it fills the block.
---
--- Centered rather than the protocol's default of top. Every level reserves a
--- second row while only `#` fills it, so at the top the glyphs hug the upper
--- edge and leave the rest of the block empty underneath — most obviously at
--- `######`, which is 1.17x in a block twice as tall. Centering splits that
--- slack in two: roughly 0.4 rows above and below at `######`, 0.25 at `###`.

--- Split a heading's text into the runs one OSC 66 escape code may carry, and
--- report how many cells the painted result covers.
---
--- At plain `s` scaling the terminal splits the text into cells itself (`w=0`)
--- and one run is enough. With a fractional scale the cells do not shrink with
--- the font, so each run has to state the width it wants in `w=` — see
--- `LEVEL_SCALES` — and that width is a whole number of cells while the text
--- inside it is not.
---
--- `w` is therefore rounded *up*, never to nearest: given less room than its
--- text needs, Kitty drops the overflowing characters outright (measured —
--- `w=6` with seven characters of 1.75x text renders six of them). The cost of
--- rounding up is slack at the right-hand end of the run, which paints as
--- heading background and reads as a gap in the middle of a word.
---
--- Where the run ends is picked to hide that slack. A run that lands exactly on
--- a whole number of cells has none, so that is preferred; failing that the run
--- is cut after the last space it contains, which turns the slack into a
--- slightly wider word gap. Only a word longer than one run can force a visible
--- gap. Text of a single cell width — plain ASCII, or plain CJK — always lands
--- exactly and never reaches the fallback.
--- Hiding the slack costs cells, because a run cut short of the chunk carries
--- its own rounding. `budget` lets the caller say how many cells are actually
--- free; over that, the pretty split is dropped for the compact one.
---
--- An emoji ends whatever run it would have joined and takes one of its own,
--- because Kitty cannot render it alongside text — see `needs_own_run`. It
--- carries its own rounding too, so a heading with emoji in it is wider than
--- `strwidth * ratio` by more than the one block the rest of the module assumes;
--- a heading that then no longer fits is left plain rather than clipped, which

---
--- This was 80 ms, on the reasoning that a heading dropping to plain size and
--- coming back inside that is not something the eye resolves. A screen
--- recording says otherwise. Under a configuration where something repaints on

---
--- Saying the same thing again costs a few hundred bytes and needs no `:mode`,

---   * The layout it wrote is recorded, and `state.owes_invalidate` carries

---     `last_layout` stale was the obvious thing and it was wrong: `reassert`
---     only re-sends when the layout matches, so a stale key disabled the
---     one path that keeps the runs alive against a repaint by somebody else
---     — for the whole debounce, and a wheel being turned re-arms that
---     debounce at `BURST_MS` for as long as it keeps turning. Recovery then
---     fell to whatever else happened to repaint, which measured as a flat
---     50 ms: `md-render.image`'s own debounce, not ours.
---   * The write is scheduled rather than immediate. `WinScrolled` fires
---     before Neovim has flushed its own redraw for the rows it moved, and
---     that flush would paint straight over anything written here.
---
--- The same applies to a window opening or closing, which is why this is also
--- reached from `WinNew` and `WinClosed` rather than only from a scroll.

--- Measured against it: 308 calls to `nvim_open_win` produced one `WinNew`,
--- and 295 to `nvim_win_close` produced two `WinClosed`. Every one of those
--- recomposed the screen and took the runs with it, and this module was blind
--- to all of them.
---
--- A decoration provider is not an autocmd, so `'eventignore'` does not reach
--- it. Measured the same way, driving thirty rounds of that exact pattern:
--- `WinNew` 0, `WinClosed` 0, `on_end` 32. It is the one signal that says "the
--- screen was just redrawn" whoever did it and however they did it.
---
--- `on_start` clears the terminal-only blocks before Neovim redraws.
--- `on_end` schedules their restoration after Neovim flushes the grid,
--- coalescing writes and bypassing the rate limit `SafeState` needs.
