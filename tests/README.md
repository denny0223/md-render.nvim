# Tests

## Overview

| Layer | What | Catches | Where | How |
|-------|------|---------|-------|-----|
| 1. Unit tests | The bytes md-render *emits* | Protocol regressions | CI (push/PR) | `make test` |
| 2. Media tools | The commands md-render *runs* | An external tool changing under us | CI (push/PR **and weekly**) | `nvim --headless -u NONE --noplugin -l tests/media_test.lua` |
| 3. Terminal | What the terminal actually *holds* | Scaled text drawn wrong, or not at all | CI (push/PR **and weekly**) | `tests/terminal_test.py` |
| 4. Visual regression | What the terminal actually *draws* | Clipped glyphs, images that never paint | Local only | `./tests/run_visual_test.sh` |

Layer 2 exists because of a silent breakage: FFmpeg 9 removed `-vsync`, frame extraction failed for every video and animated GIF, and nothing noticed — the emitted escape sequences were still correct and no commit had touched the code. The failure mode was the toolchain moving, so the test runs on a schedule, not just on push.

## Running all CI tests locally

```bash
for f in tests/*_test.lua; do
  echo "=== $f ==="
  nvim --headless -u NONE --noplugin -l "$f"
done
```

### Optional Snacks integration tests

The Snacks backend lifecycle tests use a real Snacks checkout while intercepting terminal output and controlling conversion timing. Set its path to include them in `make test`:

```bash
MD_RENDER_SNACKS_PATH=/path/to/snacks.nvim make test
```

Without this optional dependency, those integration tests report a skip. They check placement rebuilding, inactive-tab completion, and rapid zoom cleanup; they do not establish terminal visual correctness.

## Layer 1: Unit tests

Mock-based tests that verify Kitty Graphics Protocol escape sequences without requiring a real terminal.

- `image_test.lua` -- `transmit_image`, `put_image`, crop parameters, delete commands, batch mode, terminal detection
- `tty_test.lua` -- TTY discovery (isatty, ttyname, socket peer)
- `link_types_test.lua` -- Link type distinction (external, anchor, Obsidian)
- `markdown_checkbox_test.lua` -- Checkbox rendering
- `html_table_test.lua` -- HTML table parsing

Tests monkey-patch `vim.api.nvim_ui_send` to capture the bytes the image module would emit (mirrors Neovim's own `test/functional/ui/img_spec.lua`). The image module also exposes `_set_kitty_supported` and `_reset_image_id` for state control.

## Layer 2: Media tool tests

`media_test.lua` runs the real external tools (ffmpeg, ffprobe, ImageMagick, sips) against the bundled assets in `assets/demo/` and asserts that frames and PNGs actually come out.

Two details make it meaningful rather than decorative:

- **It forces a cache miss.** Both the frame cache and the converted-PNG cache are keyed on a hash of the source path, so testing a bundled path directly would hit a cache from an earlier run and never invoke the tool. The test copies each asset to a unique temporary path first.
- **It refuses to pass by not testing.** A missing tool is reported as `skip` so contributors without ffmpeg can still run `make test`, but CI sets `MD_RENDER_REQUIRE_MEDIA_TOOLS=1`, which turns every skip into a failure.

The test prints the version of each tool it found; when the matrix goes red the first useful question is which toolchain it went red on.

### FFmpeg matrix

`.github/workflows/media.yml` runs the suite against FFmpeg 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.0 and master, plus a weekly `schedule`.

Spanning majors is the point. Ubuntu 24.04 still ships FFmpeg 6.1, so a job that ran `apt-get install ffmpeg` would have stayed green through the entire `-vsync` incident. The 8.x/9.x/master entries point at BtbN's rolling `latest` release, so the scheduled run picks up new point releases and reports drift; 6.1 and 7.1 come from a pinned older autobuild, because BtbN drops EOL branches from `latest` while keeping the release assets reachable.

## Layer 3: Terminal tests

`terminal_test.py` launches a real Kitty (under `xvfb-run` when present), runs Neovim with the plugin, and asserts on what the terminal ended up holding.

The trick that makes this cheap is that `kitty @ get-text --ansi` **round-trips OSC 66 verbatim**:

```
ESC ] 66 ; s=2 ; Level One Heading ESC \
ESC ] 66 ; s=2:n=3:d=4:w=6 ; Level Th ESC \
```

So "is this heading drawn at 1.5x" is an exact string match — no screenshot, no SSIM, and none of the font or timing sensitivity of comparing images. It asserts that each of `#` … `######` scales at the metadata its level is supposed to use, that no run asks for more than the 7 cells `w=` allows, that a long CJK heading is scaled end to end rather than only as far as it happened to fit, that the level icon stays out of the payload (it gets clipped inside a scaled run), and that nothing is scaled when the feature is off.

A fractionally scaled heading goes out as several runs — `n=` / `d=` shrink the font but not the cells, so each run states its own width — which is why the assertions join a level's payloads back together before matching.

`.github/workflows/terminal.yml` runs it against Kitty **0.40.0** (the version that introduced the protocol, so the floor this can work on) and **latest**, crossed with Neovim **v0.12.0** and **nightly**, plus a weekly schedule.

Ubuntu's own kitty package is 0.32 — below the 0.40 the protocol needs — so the workflow takes the release tarball. Kitty then needs its runtime dependencies installed by hand: `fontconfig` plus a font, and the X client libraries it `dlopen`s (`libxcursor1`, `libxrandr2`, `libxi6`, `libxinerama1`, `libxkbcommon-x11-0`). A missing one is a startup failure, not a link error — without libXcursor kitty dies with `Failed to dlopen .../kitty.glfw-x11.so`.

## Layer 4: Visual regression tests

Screenshot-based tests that launch real terminal emulators and compare rendered output against reference images.

### Requirements

- macOS (uses `screencapture` and Quartz for window capture)
- At least one of: WezTerm, Kitty, Ghostty
- ImageMagick (`magick`) for SSIM comparison
- **PyObjC**: `pip install pyobjc-framework-Quartz`. Without it the capture cannot be scoped to one window and the script aborts.
- **Screen Recording permission** for whatever runs the script (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording)

This layer is a deliberate gate, not something to run on every save. Most questions people reach for a screenshot to answer are cheaper in layer 3: it opens GUI windows and takes over the screen while it runs, and a whole-window SSIM is sensitive to font, colorscheme and OS updates.

### Usage

```bash
# First time: capture screenshots and save as reference
./tests/run_visual_test.sh --update

# After changes: capture and compare against reference (SSIM threshold: 0.95)
./tests/run_visual_test.sh

# Compare only (skip capture, use existing screenshots)
./tests/run_visual_test.sh --compare
```

### When to run

- After changing image display logic (`image.lua`, `display_utils.lua`)
- After changing layout/rendering (`content_builder.lua`)
- Before releases

### When to update reference images

```bash
./tests/run_visual_test.sh --update
```

Run this after intentional visual changes (new features, layout adjustments). Review the screenshots in `tests/screenshots/` before committing the updated references.

### Output

```
tests/screenshots/
  wezterm.png          # Latest capture
  kitty.png
  ghostty.png
  reference/           # Baseline images (tracked in git)
    wezterm.png
    kitty.png
    ghostty.png
  diff/                # SSIM diff images (gitignored)
    wezterm.png
    kitty.png
    ghostty.png
```

### Notes

- The test Markdown (`tests/fixtures/visual_test.md`) avoids using the same image file in multiple places to prevent WezTerm image ID conflicts.
- Animated GIF tests are included -- the animation timer affects image placement timing on WezTerm.
- `tests/capture_window.py` finds the window by **title**, not PID: terminals re-exec, so the PID the shell holds often does not own the window. `tests/visual_test_init.lua` sets the title from Neovim via `'title'` (OSC 2), which every supported terminal honours — unlike the per-terminal command line flags, which differ and do not all set the name macOS reports.
- The script **never falls back to a full-screen capture**. An earlier version did, and with PyObjC missing it silently photographed the whole desktop and wrote it out as a reference image.
- Much of what a screenshot is reached for can be answered without pixels: `kitty @ get-text` reports the actual cell grid, which is enough to check things like whether a heading occupies a two-row multicell group. Reserve this layer for questions that genuinely need pixels.

## Adding new tests

Follow the existing pattern:

```lua
-- tests/my_test.lua
-- Run: nvim --headless -u NONE --noplugin -l tests/my_test.lua

package.path = vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/lua/?.lua;" .. vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/lua/?/init.lua;" .. package.path

local pass_count = 0
local fail_count = 0

local function test(name, fn)
  local ok, err = pcall(fn)
  if not ok then
    fail_count = fail_count + 1
    print("ERROR: " .. name .. ": " .. tostring(err))
  end
end

-- ... tests ...

print(string.format("\n%d passed, %d failed", pass_count, fail_count))
if fail_count > 0 then os.exit(1) end
```

`make test` globs `tests/*_test.lua`, so a new file is picked up automatically — no workflow change needed.
