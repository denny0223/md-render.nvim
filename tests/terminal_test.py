"""
Terminal end-to-end test: drive a real Kitty and assert on what it actually holds.

Sits between the unit tests (which check the bytes md-render emits) and the
visual regression tests (which compare pixels). The trick that makes this layer
cheap is that `kitty @ get-text --ansi` round-trips OSC 66 verbatim:

    ESC ] 66 ; s=2 ; Level One Heading ESC \\
    ESC ] 66 ; s=2:n=3:d=4:w=6 ; Level Th ESC \\

So "is this heading drawn at 1.5x" is answerable as an exact string match, with
no screenshot, no SSIM, and none of the font or timing sensitivity that comes
with comparing images.

Usage:
    tests/terminal_test.py                 # auto-detect kitty, use xvfb if present
    tests/terminal_test.py --kitty /path/to/kitty

Exits non-zero on failure.
